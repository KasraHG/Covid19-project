COVID-19 Data Analysis Queries
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data to extract key insights, including death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress across various locations and continents. The queries are based on two datasets: coviddeaths and covidvaccinations.\

## Tableau Project: COVID-19 Dashboard

I have visualized COVID-19 data in Tableau. You can explore the project by clicking on the link below:

Key Queries
Below is a collection of queries used to explore COVID-19 data and generate insights.

1. Filter Data by Continent and Sort
This query filters out rows where the continent is null and sorts the data by specific columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 3, 4;
```
2. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths (Iran)
This query calculates the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 by comparing total deaths to total cases in a specific location (Iran).

```sql
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%Iran%'
ORDER BY 2;
```
3. Total Cases vs. Population (Iran)
This query calculates the percentage of the population that got infected with COVID-19 in Iran by dividing total cases by the population.

```sql
SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentOfPopulationInfected
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%Iran%'
ORDER BY 2;
```
4. Countries with Highest Infection Rate (by Population)
This query finds the countries with the highest infection rate, which is calculated by dividing total cases by population.

```sql
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, (MAX(total_cases)::numeric / population) * 100 AS PercentagePopulationInfected
FROM coviddeaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY PercentagePopulationInfected DESC;
```
5. Countries with Highest Death Count (per Population)
This query identifies countries with the highest death count relative to their population.

```sql
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS INT)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
HAVING MAX(total_deaths) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;
```
6. Breakdown of Death Counts by Continent
This query groups death counts by location in cases where the continent is NULL, showing death counts in regions that are not associated with a continent.

```sql
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS INT)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
GROUP BY location
HAVING MAX(total_deaths) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;
```
7. Countries with Highest Death Count (Summed per Location)
This query sums the total deaths per location and orders them by the highest values.

```sql
SELECT location, SUM(total_deaths)
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY SUM(total_deaths) DESC;
```
8. Global COVID-19 Numbers
This query calculates global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage (death cases relative to total cases).

```sql
SELECT sum(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths AS int)) AS total_deaths, SUM(new_deaths) / sum(new_cases) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2;
```
9. Vaccination Data and Total Population Comparison
This query calculates the rolling total of vaccinations over time, grouped by location. It joins coviddeaths and covidvaccinations to provide insights into vaccination progress.

```sql
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
       SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM coviddeaths AS dea
JOIN covidvaccinations AS vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 2, 3;
```
10. Common Table Expression (CTE) for Population vs Vaccinations
This CTE creates a temporary result set for calculating rolling vaccinations and then calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated.

```sql
WITH PopvsVac(continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
AS (
    SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
           SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
    FROM coviddeaths AS dea
    JOIN covidvaccinations AS vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
    WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated / population) * 100 AS PercentagePopulationVaccinated
FROM PopvsVac;
```
11. Temporary Table to Store Vaccination Data
This query demonstrates how to create a temporary table to store vaccination data and later calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Percentagepopulationvaccinated;

CREATE TABLE Percentagepopulationvaccinated (
    Continent VARCHAR(225),
    Location VARCHAR(255),
    Data TIMESTAMP,
    Population NUMERIC,
    New_vaccinations NUMERIC,
    RollingPeopleVaccinated NUMERIC
);
```
```sql
INSERT INTO Percentagepopulationvaccinated (Continent, Location, Data, Population, New_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
       SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM coviddeaths AS dea
JOIN covidvaccinations AS vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated / population) * 100 AS PercentagePopulationVaccinated
FROM Percentagepopulationvaccinated;
```
12. Creating a View for Vaccination Data
This query creates a view that joins coviddeaths and covidvaccinations and provides a rolling sum of new vaccinations, making the query reusable for future analysis.

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS Percentagepopulationvaccinated;

CREATE VIEW Percentagepopulationvaccinated AS
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
       SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM coviddeaths AS dea
JOIN covidvaccinations AS vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL;

SELECT * FROM Percentagepopulationvaccinated;
```

13. Total Death Count by Non-Country Entities (e.g., Continents)
``` sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Location, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS INT)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE continent IS NULL
  AND location NOT IN ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;
```
14. Highest Infection Rate vs. Population by Country (Over Time)
``` sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT location,
       date,
       population,
       MAX(total_cases) AS HIGHESTINFECTIONCOUNT,
       (MAX(total_cases)::numeric / population) * 100 AS Percentagepopulationinfected
FROM coviddeaths
GROUP BY location, population, date
ORDER BY Percentagepopulationinfected DESC, location;
```

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
